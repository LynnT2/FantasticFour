                            shopping. I bought what I needed and proceeded to leave the store. When I was waiting to
                            cross into the parking lot, he then approached me — he was a man in his 30s and around 6’
                            tall. He began to shout, “YOU F*CKING CH*NK GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY!” I froze and was

                            Then he proceeded to harass all the people in line to the grocery market (majority Asian
                            people) and went on a racist tirade, going right up into people's faces and yelling "F*ck
