        The COVID 19 pandemic has raised verbal and physical attacks against primarily East Asian people, due to the
        initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China. However, racism towards Asian communities has existed since the
        establishment of the United States, with explicitly anti-Asian policies and laws defining the experience of
        Asian people in the country. Societal narratives about Asian communities have transformed over time and
        influenced peoples positive and negative perceptions, but discrimination directed towards Asian communities has
        all but disappeared.<br>
        We plan on investigating the different patterns of Asian American hate crimes throughout the United States in
        the past three decades. Patterns of interest include the rates of Asian hate crimes during each decade,
        important events that sparked an increase in Asian hate crimes, and differences in the prevalence of Asian hate
        crimes across regions. The spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the continuation of
        historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country. It is important to recognize the patterns and consistency of
        Asian discrimination.
