        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        The United States has witnessed an increase in verbal and physical violence against
         Asian communities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
         a result of the initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China. 
         Although the recent escalation of hate crimes is substantial, 
         racism directed towards Asians has been prevalent in the U.S since 
         the 19th century.  
         Identifying and acknowledging important historical events related to 
         Asian-Americans allows us to frame the current brutality of hate crimes 
         faced by Asian communities. <br><br>
         Mapping data allows us visualize important events and patterns.
         Our goal is to spotlight different patterns of Asian American hate crimes 
         throughout the U.S. in the past two years; specifically considering the location 
         of the hate crime and the age, gender, and nationality of victims. Historical data 
         helps us understand past patterns of institutional and 
         personal discrimination against Asians in the U.S. Historical patterns of 
         interest include the rates of Asian discrimination during each century, 
         specific events that sparked an increase in anti-Asian sentiment, and 
         differences in the prevalence of Asian hate crimes across regions. 
         The spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the 
         continuation of historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country. 
         The consistency of Asian discrimination is an important story to recognize. <br>




         <h1>Map Instructions</h1>
         The map showcases two different categories of information: Asian American 
         history and recent anti-Asian violent attacks. If the user desires to view 
         one layer alone, they can hover over the box in the upper right corner and 
         check off the layer they would not like to currently see or check a layer on 
         to view it. To zoom into the map press the “+” button on the top left corner, to zoom out of the map press the “-“ button on the top left corner. <br><br>
         
         Markers representing historical events in Asian American history are 
         characterized by blue circles. When you hover over each circle information (title, date, description) about the event appears in a pop-up window. <br><br>
         
         Recent anti-Asian violent attacks are characterized by yellow, green, and red circles. 
         The yellow and green clusters demonstrate where hate incidents are concentrated within a state, 
         which is the number initially seen on the map. Each cluster represents the number of red markers in the 
         region. As one zooms in closer, the number on the clusters shrinks to accurately represent the number of 
         attacks concentrated in a location. Red markers provide information about a single attack (location, 
         description, link, data). <br>
         <h1>Navigate the Timeline</h2>
         The timeline at the bottom of the page corresponds with historical events on the map. Hover over a marker on the timeline to see the time period and the event, and click on the marker to travel to the location of the event(s) on the map. After clicking on the marker, a description of the event will appear on the timeline. Click the “x” at the right corner of the timeline to exist the description and pick a new spot on the timeline to visit. Categories on the timeline include art, government, strikes, violence, and education.
