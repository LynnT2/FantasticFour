       <p>The United States has witnessed an increase in verbal and physical attacks against Asian communities since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, a result of the initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China. Although the recent escalation of hate crimes is substantial,racism directed towards Asians has been prevalent in the U.S since the 19th century. Anti-Asian policies, ideologies, and varying forms of violent actions are defining features of American history. Identifying and acknowledging important historical events related to Asian-Americans allows us to frame the current brutality of hate-crimes faced by Asian communities.<br> 
        We plan on investigating the different patterns of Asian American hate crimes throughout the United States in the past three decades. Patterns of interest include the rates of Asian hate crimes during each decade, important events that sparked an increase in Asian hate crimes, and differences in the prevalence of Asian hate crimes across regions. The spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the continuation of historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country. It is important to recognize the patterns and consistency of Asian discrimination throughout the past few centuries. </p>
