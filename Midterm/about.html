        <h1>About The Project</h1>
        The United States has witnessed an increase in verbal and physical violence against
         Asian communities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
         a result of the initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China. 
         Although the recent escalation of hate crimes is substantial, 
         racism directed towards Asians has been prevalent in the U.S since 
         the 19th century. Anti-Asian policies, ideologies, and varying 
         forms of violent actions are defining features of American history. 
         Identifying and acknowledging important historical events related to 
         Asian-Americans allows us to frame the current brutality of hate crimes 
         faced by Asian communities..<br><br>
         Our goal is to investigate different patterns of Asian American hate crimes 
         throughout the U.S. in the past two years; specifically considering the location 
         of the hate crime and the age, gender, and nationality of victims. We intend on 
         using our historical data to understand past patterns of institutional and 
         personal discrimination against Asians in the U.S. Historical patterns of 
         interest include the rates of Asian discrimination during each century, 
         specific events that sparked an increase in anti-Asian sentiment, and 
         differences in the prevalence of Asian hate crimes across regions. T
         he spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the 
         continuation of historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country. 
         It is important to recognize the patterns and consistency of Asian discrimination.
