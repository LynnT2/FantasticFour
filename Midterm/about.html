        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        The United States has witnessed an increase in verbal and physical violence against
        Asian communities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        a result of the initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China.
        Although the recent escalation of hate crimes is substantial,
        racism directed towards Asians has been prevalent in the U.S since
        the 19th century.
        Identifying and acknowledging important historical events related to
        Asian-Americans allows us to frame the current brutality of hate crimes
        faced by Asian communities. <br><br>
        Mapping data allows us visualize important events and patterns.
        Our goal is to spotlight different patterns of Asian American hate crimes
        throughout the U.S. in the past two years; specifically considering the location
        of the hate crime and the age, gender, and nationality of victims. Historical data
        helps us understand past patterns of institutional and
        personal discrimination against Asians in the U.S. Historical patterns of
        interest include the rates of Asian discrimination during each century,
        specific events that sparked an increase in anti-Asian sentiment, and
        differences in the prevalence of Asian hate crimes across regions.
        The spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the
        continuation of historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country.
        The consistency of Asian discrimination is an important story to recognize. <br>




        <h1>Map Instructions</h1>
        The map showcases two different categories of information: Asian American
        history and recent anti-Asian violent attacks. If the user desires to view
        one layer alone, they can hover over the box in the upper right corner and
        check off the layer they would not like to currently see or check a layer on
        to view it. To zoom into the map press the “+” button on the top left corner, to zoom out of the map press the
        “-“ button on the top left corner. <br><br>

        Markers representing historical events in Asian American history are
        characterized by blue circles. When you hover over each circle information (title, date, description) about the
        event appears in a pop-up window. <br><br>

        Recent anti-Asian violent attacks are characterized by yellow, green, and red circles.
        The yellow and green clusters demonstrate where hate incidents are concentrated within a state,
        which is the number initially seen on the map. Each cluster represents the number of red markers in the
        region. As one zooms in closer, the number on the clusters shrinks to accurately represent the number of
        attacks concentrated in a location. Red markers provide information about a single attack (location,
        description, link, data). <br><br>
        <h1>Navigate the Timeline</h1>
        The timeline at the bottom of the page corresponds with historical events on the map. Hover over a marker on
        the timeline to see the time period and the event, and click on the marker to travel to the location of the
        event(s) on the map. After clicking on the marker, a description of the event will appear on the timeline.
        Click the “x” at the right corner of the timeline to exist the description and pick a new spot on the
        timeline to visit. Categories on the timeline include art, government, strikes, violence, and education.
        <br><br>

        <h1>Data</h1>
        Our group acquired data from multiple sources that were either given to us by Professor Yoh Kawano or collected by the US Census Bureau.
        Professor Yoh connected us with Silvia Gonzales from Movement Hub who generously shared their Airtable with us. Although we didn't use Silvia's datasets
        we drew inspiration from their countless resources.<br><br>
        

        <!-- The data that our group acquired was generated by the UCLA Digital Humanities Department. Our group reached out
        to Professor Sanders Garcia, who worked to grant us access to three files. One set of data was consolidated from
        minor degree applications for Digital Humanities, where the applicants, both admitted and denied, stated their
        major, their career aspirations, their general understanding of Digital Humanities and their anticipated
        graduation year. The next data set looked at current Digital Humanities students and the final dataset was
        collected from graduates who completed the digital humanities minor program. This data presents their current
        and past professional positions, graduation year, and current field of work. Both datasets were collected by the
        Digital Humanities department.<br><br>

        After looking over the data sets, our team thought of the other “columns” that would have been useful for a
        deeper analysis of the trends of Digital Humanities students at UCLA. Regarding the dataset that included the
        Digital Humanities applications, we wish that the ethnic background of the applicants had been collected so that
        we could include analysis on this topic in our project. A look into this kind of information could add another
        level of analysis to the Digital Humanities applicants, so it is unfortunate that it is not included. Another
        component that is missing is whether or not the students that were applying to digital humanities were in-state
        students, out-of-state students or international students. When considering applicants into a program as new and
        interesting as Digital Humanities, students’ hometowns could have been a unique component to investigate. A
        final thing that was missing from this dataset was whether or not the students applying into the program were
        transfer students. A student’s connection to UCLA is very much correlated to the amount of time that they have
        in order to orient themselves with the school and this information could have helped us shape our understanding
        as to the type of person that applies to the Digital Humanities program. Looking at the data collected about the
        graduates of the Digital Humanities program, one key thing that is missing that we believe could have helped
        shape a better understanding of the influence Digital Humanities had on the student and their career is
        extracurricular involvement at UCLA. Being the dynamic research institution that UCLA is, a look into the other
        things that these students were involved with at UCLA could paint a better picture as to how they used Digital
        Humanities to supplement their college experience and lead them to their career. In addition, for the dataset on
        ucla graduates, another missing thing that may have shone light on the practicality of Digital Humanities is
        data on new skills students had obtained through the minor. An examination of skills learnt from the minor
        together with student’s occupation after graduation could potentially reveal practical helpfulness of the minor
        on student career.<br><br>

        The data that we have access to was collected for two separate reasons. The dataset that maps out the Digital
        Humanities minor applicants was garnered from an application that meant to seek out which UCLA students, among
        those that applied, would be best qualified for admission into the program. From this perspective it makes sense
        that certain data wouldn’t be important to be collected as it wouldn’t affect whether or not a candidate was
        qualified or capable of enrolling in the program. This lens explains why certain demographic and personal data
        is missing about the applicants. The dataset regarding the graduated Digital Humanities students was collected
        for a different reason. This data was acquired to have a better understanding of what Digital Humanities
        students do with their experience with the program after they graduate and go out into the workforce. It could
        also be used as an educational tool for current Digital Humanities students to better understand what careers
        and possibilities there are after university with a Digital Humanities background. When considering this, there
        would be little reason for this data to call back other information about these prior students such as other
        programs and minors that they were involved with at UCLA, although they could also have had an important
        influence on their careers.--><br><br>
