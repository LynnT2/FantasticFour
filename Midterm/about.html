        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        The United States has witnessed an increase in verbal and physical violence against
        Asian communities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        a result of the initial detection of the virus in Wuhan, China.
        Although the recent escalation of hate crimes is substantial,
        racism directed towards Asians has been prevalent in the U.S since
        the 19th century.
        Identifying and acknowledging important historical events related to
        Asian-Americans allows us to frame the current brutality of hate crimes
        faced by Asian communities. <br><br>
        Mapping data allows us visualize important events and patterns.
        Our goal is to spotlight different patterns of Asian American hate crimes
        throughout the U.S. in the past two years; specifically considering the location
        of the hate crime and the age, gender, and nationality of victims. Historical data
        helps us understand past patterns of institutional and
        personal discrimination against Asians in the U.S. Historical patterns of
        interest include the rates of Asian discrimination during each century,
        specific events that sparked an increase in anti-Asian sentiment, and
        differences in the prevalence of Asian hate crimes across regions.
        The spikes in Asian hate crimes over the past few years demonstrate the
        continuation of historical anti-Asian sentiments in the country.
        The consistency of Asian discrimination is an important story to recognize. <br>




        <h1>Map Instructions</h1>
        The map showcases two different categories of information: Asian American
        history and recent anti-Asian violent attacks. If the user desires to view
        one layer alone, they can hover over the box in the upper right corner and
        check off the layer they would not like to currently see or check a layer on
        to view it. To zoom into the map press the “+” button on the top left corner, to zoom out of the map press the
        “-“ button on the top left corner. <br><br>

        Markers representing historical events in Asian American history are
        characterized by blue circles. When you hover over each circle information (title, date, description) about the
        event appears in a pop-up window. <br><br>

        Recent anti-Asian violent attacks are characterized by yellow, green, and red circles.
        The yellow and green clusters demonstrate where hate incidents are concentrated within a state,
        which is the number initially seen on the map. Each cluster represents the number of red markers in the
        region. As one zooms in closer, the number on the clusters shrinks to accurately represent the number of
        attacks concentrated in a location. Red markers provide information about a single attack (location,
        description, link, data). <br><br>
        <h1>Navigate the Timeline</h1>
        The timeline at the bottom of the page corresponds with historical events on the map. Hover over a marker on
        the timeline to see the time period and the event, and click on the marker to travel to the location of the
        event(s) on the map. After clicking on the marker, a description of the event will appear on the timeline.
        Click the “x” at the right corner of the timeline to exist the description and pick a new spot on the
        timeline to visit. Categories on the timeline include art, government, strikes, violence, and education.
        <br><br>

        <h1>Data</h1>
        Our group acquired data from multiple sources that were either given to us by Professor Yoh Kawano or collected
        by the US Census Bureau. Professor Yoh connected us with Silvia Gonzales from Movement Hub who generously 
        shared their Airtable with us. Although we didn't use Silvia's datasets, we drew inspiration from their resources directory.
