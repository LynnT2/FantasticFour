## UX Design
### Mindmaps


Haiqi's Mind Map
 <br>
    <img src = "Mindmaps/Haiqimindmap .jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Haiqi reactions:
    - Adriana: I love the idea of a welcome page and how the timeline could be interactive with the map!
    - Labiba: the idea that clicking on timeline brings users to different parts of the page sounds really nice! I also think it is nice to figure out a visual theme for the web page and the gradient background sounds really cool! My concern would be that some topics that we touch on might be heavy, so we might want to avoid using bright colors.
    - Lynn: similar to Labiba’s and Adrianna’s idea, Lynn also suggests an interactive timeline, which is definitely something that we can work on!


Labiba's Mind Map
 <br>
    <img src = "Mindmaps/Labiba mindmap.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Labiba reactions:
    - Adriana: Buttons would make the user experience much smoother!
    - Haiqi: Hopefully, we’ll soon acquire the skills to implement a choropleth map with popup graphs!
    - Lynn: I like that Lynn was really thinking about the user’s thought process while navigating the website!


Adriana's Mind Map
 <br>
    <img src = "Mindmaps/adrianamindmap.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Adriana’s reactions:
    - Labiba: I like the idea of having images flip over and then have a description!
    -   Haiqi: I like the idea of visualizing potential factors that influenced an increase in hate crimes towards Asian Americans!
    - Lynn: I like the idea of a menu bar for navigation purposes and clicking on different points of the maps to travel!


Lynn's Mind Map
 <br>
    <img src = "Mindmaps/Lynn Mindmap.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Lynn’s reactions:
    - Labiba: Labiba thought of cards that could be flipped over with a click to show personal stories of those affected by AsianAm hate crimes, a great way to further engage our users
    - Adriana: Adriana has the idea to present a compelling welcome screen to grab the attention of our user, super cool
    - Haiqi: Haiqi’s toggle box reminds me of Excel’s Pivot Chart feature, which is a convenient way for a user to customize their experience when navigating the data points on the map/timeline


### Crazy Eights

Haiqi's Crazy Eights
 <br>
    <img src = "Crazy Eights/Haiqi Crazy Eights .jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Haiqi reactions:
    - Adriana: I think it would be cool to associate different time periods with different colors and shapes! 
    - Labiba: I love the idea of image flipping! Hopefully that’s something we can do. About music, my concern is similar to the use of color – for certain parts we might want to avoid happy music.


Labiba's Crazy Eights 
 <br>
    <img src = "Crazy Eights/Labiba Crazy Eights.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Labiba reactions:
    - Adriana: I really like the idea of having buttons to navigate to different parts of the website!
    - Haiqi: Hopefully, we’ll soon acquire the skills to implement a choropleth map with popup graphs!
    - Lynn: Lynn’s crazy eights were very detailed and I really like the idea of an interactive timeline!


Adriana's Crazy Eights
 <br>
    <img src = "Crazy Eights/adrianacrazy8.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Adriana’s reactions:
    - Labiba: I love the idea of saturation gradients that correlate to different points in history!
    - Haiqi: I love the idea of incorporating data that connects to UCLA!
    - Lynn: I like how straight forward and easy to navigate all of the pages are. I know I already created the About Us for the storyboard after writing this but I'd love to eventually create something similar to the simple version you created!


Lynn's Crazy Eights
 <br>
    <img src = "Crazy Eights/Lynn Crazy Eights.jpg" width = "400">
    </br>
- Lynn’s reactions:
    - Labiba: Labiba brought up a great idea to utilize colors to categorize the time periods our data is set in
    - Adriana: Adriana included the data categorizations into her crazy eights. Having all the data consolidated in a non map-interactive format is very important for accessibility purposes
    - Haiqi: Haiqi introduced a medium we haven’t considered yet—video! Adding videos that are relevant to our data points is another great way to convey our    information
