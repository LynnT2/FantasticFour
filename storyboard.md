## UX Design
### Mindmaps

- Haiqi reactions:
    - Adriana: I love the idea of a welcome page and how the timeline could be interactive with the map!
    - Labiba: the idea that clicking on timeline brings users to different parts of the page sounds really nice! I also think it is nice to figure out a visual theme for the web page and the gradient background sounds really cool! My concern would be that some topics that we touch on might be heavy, so we might want to avoid using bright colors.
    - Lynn: similar to Labiba’s and Adrianna’s idea, Lynn also suggests an interactive timeline, which is definitely something that we can work on!

- Labiba reactions:
    - Adriana: Buttons would make the user experience much smoother!
    - Haiqi: Hopefully, we’ll soon acquire the skills to implement a choropleth map with popup graphs!
    - Lynn: I like that Lynn was really thinking about the user’s thought process while navigating the website!

- Adriana’s reactions:
    - Labiba: I like the idea of having images flip over and then have a description!
    -   Haiqi: I like the idea of visualizing potential factors that influenced an increase in hate crimes towards Asian Americans!
    - Lynn: I like the idea of a menu bar for navigation purposes and clicking on different points of the maps to travel!

### Crazy Eights
- Haiqi reactions:
    - Adriana: I think it would be cool to associate different time periods with different colors and shapes! 
    - Labiba: I love the idea of image flipping! Hopefully that’s something we can do. About music, my concern is similar to the use of color – for certain parts we might want to avoid happy music.

- Labiba reactions:
    - Adriana: I really like the idea of having buttons to navigate to different parts of the website!
    - Haiqi: Hopefully, we’ll soon acquire the skills to implement a choropleth map with popup graphs!
    - Lynn: Lynn’s crazy eights were very detailed and I really like the idea of an interactive timeline!

- Adriana’s reactions:
    - Labiba: I love the idea of saturation gradients that correlate to different points in history!
    - Haiqi: I love the idea of incorporating data that connects to UCLA!
    - Lynn:
